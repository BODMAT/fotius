                    Curricula of specialties provide fundamental mathematical training and a wide range of disciplines related to computing and programming. A significant place in the training of future specialists is occupied by practical work on computers, which is ensured by the presence at the faculty of 6 computer classes equipped with modern computer technology, which are connected to the university local network and to the Internet. In addition, during their studies, students learn to work in several operating systems and learn at least four programming languages. Also, all students learn English and a cycle of general humanities disciplines.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition, students have the opportunity to participate in research projects, working on real-world tasks under the supervision of faculty members. This allows them not only to deepen their theoretical knowledge but also to gain valuable practical experience, which is especially important for a successful career in the IT industry.
